        <h2>Established in 1909, the Bugatti car company is renowned for the level of detailed engineering in the manufacturing of its automobiles. Every car manufactured by Bugatti has had an intrinsic design right from the first car to the latest model, Bugatti Divo. Ettore Bugatti had inherited the artistic genes from his father Carlo Bugatti, an Art Nouveau furniture and jewellery designer.</h2>
